ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is a multicausal, unpredictable-course neoplasm with serious diagnostic problems and, therefore, constitutes a big burden to health care worldwide. Considering this, we have proposed a new integrated computational approach with multi-agent systems and mathematical modeling coupled with machine learning techniques. A comprehensive mathematical model covering a wide range of molecular markers was utilized to simulate the underlying biological processes in lung cancer. Meanwhile, the multi-agent system dynamically models the interaction in the tumor microenvironment. Feature prediction and robust model classification are enabled through the application of machine learning methods applied to the high-dimensional data analysis. The developed strategy thus presents an enhanced approach for forecasting the outcome of lung cancer and offers important insight into the dynamics of the disease process and into putative therapeutic targets. Therefore, such an advance in precision oncology could help toward personalized treatment strategies with better outcomes for the patients.
